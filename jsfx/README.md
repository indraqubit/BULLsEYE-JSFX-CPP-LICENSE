# JSFX Source Files

Place your original JSFX files (.jsfx) here for reference during migration.

## Usage

1. Copy your .jsfx files to this folder
2. Use them as reference when migrating to C++/JUCE
3. Compare functionality between JSFX and JUCE implementations

## Notes

- These files are for reference only - they won't be compiled
- Keep original naming for easy cross-reference
- Document any discrepancies or edge cases found

**This folder is empty by default.** Add your JSFX source files here.
